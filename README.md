Key Enhancements
Background Gradient:

The background of the entire page now uses a linear gradient (#ff7e5f to #feb47b), which gives it a warm and vibrant look.
Container Styling:

The content is wrapped in a .container div with a semi-transparent black background, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow, making the text and input elements stand out.
Typography:

The fonts and text sizes are adjusted for a modern and clean look, with the heading (h1) using uppercase letters and increased letter-spacing for a dramatic effect.
Input and Button Styling:

The input field and button are styled with padding and border-radius for a more polished appearance.
The button changes color slightly when hovered, providing a visual cue to the user.
Result Display:

The result text is given a bright yellow color (#ffeb3b) to make it more noticeable when displayed.
